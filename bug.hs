```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code compiles and runs without errors, but it hides a subtle issue.  The `sort` function in `Data.List` uses a mergesort, which has O(n log n) time complexity. For small lists, this is not noticeable, but for very large lists, the performance can be poor, especially compared to other sorting algorithms that might be better suited to specific data distributions.
